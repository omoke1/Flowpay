- ✅ Unique constraints on critical fields (wallet_address, tx_hash)

**2. API Security**
- ✅ Input validation on all API routes
- ✅ Required field checks before database operations
- ✅ Error handling without exposing sensitive data
- ✅ Proper HTTP status codes
- ✅ No direct SQL queries (using Supabase client)

**3. Flow Blockchain Security**
- ✅ Using official Flow contracts (FungibleToken, FlowToken)
- ✅ Transactions signed by user wallet (non-custodial)
- ✅ No private keys stored in application
- ✅ Transaction confirmation before marking as paid
- ✅ Testnet configuration isolated from mainnet

**4. Frontend Security**
- ✅ No sensitive data in client-side code
- ✅ Environment variables properly prefixed (NEXT_PUBLIC_)
- ✅ Wallet connection through official FCL
- ✅ User authentication checked before dashboard access

### ⚠️ Security Recommendations (Pre-Production)

**HIGH PRIORITY:**

1. **Rate Limiting**
   - ⚠️ Add rate limiting to API routes
   - Recommendation: Use Vercel Edge Config or Upstash Redis
   - Prevent spam payment link creation
   - Limit payment recording attempts

2. **Transaction Verification**
   - ⚠️ Verify transaction amounts match payment link amounts
   - ⚠️ Check transaction recipient matches merchant address
   - ⚠️ Validate transaction status on-chain before marking complete
   - Current: Trusts client-provided transaction hash

3. **Input Sanitization**
   - ⚠️ Add XSS protection for user-generated content
   - Sanitize product names and descriptions
   - Validate URLs for redirect_url field
   - Prevent injection attacks

4. **CORS Configuration**
   - ⚠️ Configure proper CORS headers for API routes
   - Restrict origins in production
   - Add CSRF protection for state-changing operations

**MEDIUM PRIORITY:**

5. **Email Security**
   - ⚠️ Validate email addresses before sending
   - Rate limit email sending
   - Add unsubscribe mechanism
   - Verify Resend domain for production

6. **Webhook Verification**
   - ⚠️ Add signature verification for Supabase webhooks
   - Verify request origin
   - Implement replay attack prevention

7. **Error Handling**
   - ⚠️ Implement proper error logging (without exposing to client)
   - Add Sentry or similar for error tracking
   - Sanitize error messages sent to frontend

8. **Session Management**
   - ⚠️ Add session timeout for wallet connections
   - Implement proper logout flow
   - Clear sensitive data on disconnect

**LOW PRIORITY (Nice to Have):**

9. **Content Security Policy**
   - Add CSP headers
   - Restrict script sources
   - Prevent clickjacking

10. **Monitoring & Alerts**
    - Set up anomaly detection
    - Alert on suspicious transaction patterns
    - Monitor for unusual API usage

---

### 🔒 Security Best Practices Followed

✅ **No Custom Cadence Contracts** - Using audited Flow core contracts
✅ **Non-Custodial** - Users maintain control of their wallets
✅ **Environment Variables** - Secrets not in codebase
✅ **HTTPS Only** - Vercel enforces HTTPS
✅ **Database Encryption** - Supabase encrypts at rest
✅ **Type Safety** - TypeScript prevents many runtime errors

3. **Check RLS policies** - Test with different user accounts
4. **Monitor transactions** - Watch for unusual patterns
5. **Keep dependencies updated** - Regular security patches
6. **Use environment variables** - Never commit secrets
7. **Test edge cases** - What if amount is 0? Negative? Huge?
8. **Handle errors gracefully** - Don't expose internal details

## Lessons

### Key Learnings from Implementation

**1. Project Structure**
- ✅ Starting with clear folder structure saves time
- ✅ Separating UI components from business logic improves maintainability
- ✅ Creating utility libraries early prevents code duplication

**2. Flow Integration**
- ✅ FCL makes wallet integration straightforward
- ✅ Using existing Flow contracts (FungibleToken, FlowToken) is faster than custom Cadence
- ✅ Testnet configuration should be isolated and clearly documented
- 📝 Note: USDC.e contract address needs verification on testnet

**3. Database Design**
- ✅ RLS policies from the start prevent security issues later
- ✅ Helper functions in SQL improve query performance
- ✅ Proper indexes on foreign keys are essential
- ✅ UUID primary keys work well with Supabase

**4. API Design**
- ✅ Consistent error handling across routes improves debugging
- ✅ Validating inputs on server prevents bad data
- ✅ Returning proper HTTP status codes helps frontend error handling
- 📝 Note: Rate limiting should be added before production

**5. UI/UX**
- ✅ Empty states guide new users effectively
- ✅ Loading states improve perceived performance
- ✅ Real-time updates create better user experience
- ✅ Copy-to-clipboard for payment links is essential
- 📝 Note: Toast notifications would improve feedback

**6. Development Workflow**
- ✅ Building incrementally (page by page) maintains momentum
- ✅ Testing locally before deployment catches issues early
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation helps future development
- ✅ Type safety (TypeScript) prevents many bugs

**7. Hackathon Strategy**
- ✅ Focus on core MVP features first
- ✅ Polish can come later (animations, icons)
- ✅ Good documentation impresses judges
- ✅ End-to-end demo is more important than perfect code
- ✅ Security audit shows thoroughness

### What Worked Well

1. **Next.js App Router** - Clean routing and API routes in one framework
2. **Supabase** - Fast database setup with built-in auth and RLS
3. **FCL** - Simple wallet integration without custom auth
4. **Tailwind CSS** - Rapid UI development with custom theme
5. **TypeScript** - Caught errors before runtime

### What Could Be Improved

1. **Animations** - Would benefit from Framer Motion
2. **Icons** - Lucide icons would improve visual appeal
3. **Form Validation** - Could use react-hook-form + zod for better UX
4. **Error Handling** - More granular error messages
5. **Testing** - Unit and integration tests would increase confidence

### Recommendations for Future Development

1. **Add E2E Tests** - Playwright or Cypress for critical flows
2. **Implement Monitoring** - Sentry for errors, Vercel Analytics for usage
3. **Add Analytics** - Track conversion rates, popular payment amounts
4. **Optimize Performance** - Code splitting, image optimization
5. **Improve Mobile UX** - Test on actual devices, optimize touch targets
6. **Add Webhooks** - Allow merchants to integrate with their systems
7. **Support More Tokens** - Add stablecoins beyond USDC
8. **Internationalization** - Support multiple languages and currencies

### Technical Debt to Address

- [ ] Add proper form validation library (react-hook-form)
- [ ] Implement comprehensive error boundaries
- [ ] Add loading skeletons instead of simple text
- [ ] Create reusable modal component
- [ ] Add proper toast notification system
- [ ] Implement optimistic UI updates
- [ ] Add unit tests for utility functions
- [ ] Create Storybook for component documentation

### Issues Fixed During Implementation

- **Error**: "tailwindcss directly as a PostCSS plugin" error
- **Solution**: Downgraded to Tailwind CSS v3.4.0 which is compatible with PostCSS config
- **Status**: ✅ Fixed - dev server now runs correctly

**Issue #2: Landing Page Design Enhancement**
- **Request**: User wanted modern glassmorphic design with gradients and animations
- **Changes Made**:
  - ✅ Redesigned landing page with gradient backgrounds
