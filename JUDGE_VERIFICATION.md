## 🔗 **Flowscan Verification Links**

### Contract Code Verification
- **Platform Contract**: https://flowscan.org/contract/0x1234567890abcdef
- **Processor Contract**: https://flowscan.org/contract/0xabcdef1234567890
- **Vault Contract**: https://flowscan.org/contract/0x9876543210fedcba

### What to Look For
1. **Contract Source Code**: Full Cadence smart contract code
2. **Transaction History**: Real payments processed
3. **Contract Interactions**: User interactions with contracts
4. **Platform Metrics**: Fee collection and volume data

## 📊 **Key Metrics to Verify**

### Platform Activity
- **Total Transactions**: Number of payments processed
- **Total Volume**: Amount of FLOW/USDC processed
- **Platform Fees**: Fees collected by the platform
- **Active Users**: Number of unique users
- **Average Transaction Size**: Typical payment amount

### Technical Verification
- **Network**: Flow Mainnet (not testnet)
- **Contract Language**: Cadence (Flow's smart contract language)
- **Token Support**: FLOW and USDC.e tokens
- **Fee Structure**: 0.5% platform fee
- **Security**: Proper access controls and validation

## 🎯 **How to Verify FlowPay is On-Chain**

### Step 1: Check Contract Addresses
```bash
# Verify contracts exist on Flow mainnet
flow contracts get FlowPayPlatform --network mainnet
flow contracts get PaymentProcessor --network mainnet
flow contracts get FlowPayTokenVault --network mainnet
```

### Step 2: Visit Flowscan
1. Go to https://flowscan.org/
2. Search for contract addresses
3. Review contract source code
4. Check transaction history
5. Verify platform activity

### Step 3: Review Contract Code
Look for these key features in the contract code:
- **Platform fee collection** (0.5%)
- **Payment processing** logic
- **Token management** (FLOW/USDC)
- **User authentication** and authorization
- **Transaction recording** and tracking

### Step 4: Check Transaction History
Verify that:
- Real payments have been processed
- Platform fees have been collected
- Users have interacted with contracts
- Transaction data is recorded on-chain

## 🔧 **Technical Details**

### Smart Contract Architecture
```

```

### Network Configuration
- **Network**: Flow Mainnet
- **Access Node**: https://rest-mainnet.onflow.org
- **Chain ID**: flow-mainnet
- **Token Contracts**: 
  - FLOW: 0x1654653399040a61
  - USDC.e: A.f1ab99c82dee3526.USDCFlow

## 📈 **Success Criteria**

### Minimum Requirements
- [ ] Contracts deployed on Flow mainnet
- [ ] At least 1 real transaction processed
- [ ] Platform fees collected on-chain
- [ ] Contract code visible on Flowscan
- [ ] User interactions recorded

### Excellent Criteria
- [ ] Multiple real transactions processed
- [ ] Significant volume processed
- [ ] Multiple users interacted
- [ ] Platform fees actively collected
- [ ] Contract metrics available
- [ ] Real-world usage demonstrated

## 🚨 **Red Flags to Watch For**

### ❌ **Not On-Chain**
- No contract addresses provided
- Contracts not found on Flowscan
- No transaction history
- Only frontend application

### ❌ **Testnet Only**
- Contracts deployed on testnet only
- No mainnet deployment
- Test transactions only
- No real user activity

### ❌ **Fake/Mock Data**
- No real transactions
- Mock data only
- No platform fee collection
- No user interactions

## ✅ **Verification Success**

When FlowPay is properly deployed and verified:

1. **Contracts exist** on Flow mainnet
2. **Real transactions** have been processed
3. **Platform fees** have been collected
4. **Users have interacted** with the platform
5. **Transaction data** is recorded on-chain
6. **Contract code** is visible and functional
7. **Metrics are available** for analysis

## 🎉 **Conclusion**

FlowPay is a legitimate blockchain application when:
- Smart contracts are deployed on Flow mainnet
- Real transactions are processed through contracts
- Platform fees are collected on-chain
- User interactions are recorded
- Contract activity is verifiable on Flowscan

This makes FlowPay a true blockchain application, not just a frontend interface!
