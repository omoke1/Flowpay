# Vercel Environment Variables Setup

## Required Environment Variables

You need to set these environment variables in your Vercel project dashboard:

### 1. Database (Supabase) - REQUIRED
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_supabase_service_role_key
```

### 2. Flow Blockchain - REQUIRED
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_WALLETCONNECT_PROJECT_ID=your_walletconnect_project_id
```

### 3. Email (Resend) - OPTIONAL
```
RESEND_API_KEY=your_resend_api_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_FROM_EMAIL=noreply@useflowpay.xyz
NEXT_PUBLIC_FROM_EMAIL_NAME=FlowPay
```

### 4. Rate Limiting (Upstash Redis) - OPTIONAL
```
UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL=your_upstash_redis_url
UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN=your_upstash_redis_token
```

### 5. Application - REQUIRED
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=https://useflowpay.xyz
NODE_ENV=production
```

## How to Set Environment Variables in Vercel

1. Go to your Vercel dashboard
2. Select your FlowPay project
3. Go to Settings â†’ Environment Variables
4. Add each variable with its value
5. Make sure to set them for "Production" environment
6. Redeploy your project after adding variables

## Current Issue

The API is returning 500 errors because the Supabase environment variables are not configured in Vercel. Once you add the required environment variables, the payment-links API should work correctly.

## Testing

After setting the environment variables:
1. Redeploy your project
2. Test the API: `GET https://useflowpay.xyz/api/payment-links?merchantId=0xe610aa56b2399957`
3. The response should be JSON instead of HTML

## Database Setup

Make sure your Supabase project has the required tables:
- `users` table with proper RLS policies
- `payment_links` table with proper RLS policies
- `payments` table with proper RLS policies

## Security Notes

- Never commit environment variables to your repository
- Use Vercel's environment variable system for production
- Keep your service role key secure and never expose it to the client
